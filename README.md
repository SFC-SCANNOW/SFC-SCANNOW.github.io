# SFC SCANNOW



SFC/scannow is the most common command of System File Checker. This command is used to scan the integrity of all protected system files, and then it will replace the incorrect, or corrupted system files with a cached copy once it finds that the protected system files are overwritten by incorrect files.



## How to run sfc/scannow? Here is the tutorial.

### **Run sfc/scannow in Windows 8 and above versions**

1. Press the Windows icon on your keyboard and type cmd in the searching box. Or press the Windows key and the X key on the keyboard.

2. Run Command Prompt as an administer by giving a right click on Command Prompt and selecting Run as administrator.

3. When the Command Prompt window shows up, please type sfc/scnnow and click Enter on the keyboard.

4. Wait until the verification is up to 100%, and you will see the scan results.

**You may receive one of the following messages, some of which indicate errors:**

		* Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.(If you receive this message, it means  that there are no missing or corrupted system files.)

## Fix Common SFC Scannow Errors

**Although sfc/scannow can automatically repair the most problems related to Windows, in some cases, there are some errors showing up when you use the command. Here are the most common errors:**

* Sfc/scannow stops scanning:Turbo Memory feature may be the cause, and you can try to disable this feature.
sfc/scannow stops you must be an administer: Facing this error, you should make sure that you are using Command Prompt as an administer.

## Is SFC Scannow Good to Run?
* Running the System File Checker Scannow command is really beneficial for the system but to some extent only. 

* You need to remember that executing the SFC Scannow command can change the settings and set them back to the default state. Notably, modifying the system files could be risky unless you are technically sound about Windows. Otherwise, it can lead to many issues and ruin the entire user experience if you don't execute it properly.

* We recommend taking a backup of your Windows system before running the System File Checker Scannow command. This is a little drawback of the SFC Scannow command.

* Running SFC Scannow isn't a bad idea. But, running it more frequently, like every day, won't make any change to the system. Running it every day would be a waste of your time and computer resources. You can run the SFC Scannow command once a month.

* We hope you must have got enough information about the SFC Scannow command. It's pretty easy to use the System File Checker tool, and you can follow the above-mentioned methods to do the same with ease.
